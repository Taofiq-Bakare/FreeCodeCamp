## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator using Numpy

Numpy is a powerful library for performing arithmetic tasks in Python.
It is faster than using the native Pythonic methods, because it get rid of
unecassary overhead bits and has more sophisticate algebraic methods.

Numpy is used in this project to transform a list of number to a 3*3 matrix.
And then return the following results as a dictionary for each row and column.

* Mean
* Variance
* Standard deviation
* Maximum and Minimum number of the matrix, and
* Sum of the martix

The result should be in this form

```python
{
  'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened]
}
```

## Demographic Data Analyzer using Pandas

This project laid emphasis on of Pandas for data analysis and manipulation such as:

* Loading data using Pandas
* Calculating percentages of different feature
* Identifying Maximum and Minimum 
* Analyzing relationship between similar and dissimilar feature
